# libft

## Project Overview
Libft is an individual project within the 42 curriculum, challenging students to recreate select standard C library functions. This endeavor aims to foster a profound understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. Notably, the 42 program restricts the use of certain standard libraries in projects, necessitating the continual expansion of this library with personally crafted functions as students progress. This involves the implementation of personalized versions of functions crucial for tasks such as string manipulation, memory allocation, and common operations in C programming.

### Contents
1. **Libc Functions:**
   - Implementation of standard C functions.

2. **Additional Functions:**
   - Functions strategically designed for future project utility.

3. **Bonus Functions:**
   - Functions tailored for efficient linked list manipulation.

4. **Personal Functions:**
   - Personally identified functions anticipated to be beneficial in later stages.
